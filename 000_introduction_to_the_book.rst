Introduction

While learning about the Linux Kernel and the File Subsystem I faced a lot of difficulties in imagining the data structures and the relations between them. Anyways, I managed to understand those by writing some code, and re-reading the references again.

Then I came accross the ``Crash`` debugger of Linux. This tool allows us to look into the live Linux kernel and see the data structures. I thought Wow !! now it will be a lot easier to understand the data stuctures.

I used the tool to iterate through the structures and see how Linux Functions underneath.

While doing that I documented the whole process so that it can be useful to others.

This is the documentation.

I have made small exercises in each section to understand them, but before you go to the assignments you will have to go through the references to understand the assignments in detail.

In the chapters I have mentioned the book and the exact chapters which one should read before proceeding with the assignments. This is essential otherwise, you will understand nothing in the assignment.

This book does not intend to be a complete reference for Linux Kernel, it aims to be a side reference for the other references by showing some exercises.
